## Spacer 3D OLED

A support is needed to produce the part in 3D printing.

The support will be printed to avoid the collapse of cantilevered parts, and will have to be removed to obtain the final part.

I recommend a *pattern support* in *lines* mode

Here the tests were carried out in PLA. Above 60Â°C in use, PLA may deform. If you want to be a little more qualitative, you can switch to PETG.
